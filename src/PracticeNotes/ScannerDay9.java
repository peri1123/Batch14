        /*
        Sting name= "Sunday";
        String name1=new String("Sunday"); || we can do
        String name2=new String();
        name2="text"
        String is immutable, can not change unless we reassigned it
        index-->positioning
       "Sunday"
       "Sunday morning"-->every single has own index number, $, spaces, except string ("") mark
       "You need to pay $100"



        ======================
        Methods of String:
        comcat();--> (Returns string)
        adding extra or new string to the string what we have it
        EX:"abc".concat("xyz");--> String str=abcxyz;
        String str1="Hi";
        str1.concat("there");// we need to reassign it
        **class name starts with uppercase && methods names are starting always with small letter
        length(); it is returns number (int) of character on the given string;
        int number=24;
        number=str1.length();
        str1.length(); **count the numbers of the word

        indexOf();--. returns index of characters as number (int)
        //if i want to get index i need to put the character and it will give us index number
        EX; str1.indexOf('i') index is 1, that's from "Hi";
        5*1
        5*str1.indexOf('i');

        charAt(); returns character from the specific index and will return char DT
        to get char I  need to put index number
        str.charAt(1) =(i) that's from "hi"

        OBJECTS CAN HAVE METHODS AND PRIMITIVES CAN NOT HAVE METHODS
        WE CAN USE PRIMITIVE AND STRING AT THE SAME CLASS

        toUpperCase();
        toLowerCase();


     SCANNER-day9

     int count=45;
     int age=21;

     STRING IS THE ANOTHER CLASS

     creating SCANNER OBJECT:

     Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);<-- syntex of Scanner
