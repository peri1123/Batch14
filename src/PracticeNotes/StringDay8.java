       ===== String =====
       is text

       -sequence of chr
       string is not primitive
       -string class in java, it is already built
       if you are creating char ch+ 'e';
       oop-object oriented program

       syntax to create a String: that's like creating primitive DT +value
       sout(word);-->Saturday// if you are putting spase it will give you space

              String word = "Saturday";
       String word1= new String("Sunday");/ this is a new object
       String word2= new String("Sunday");
       words="Monday";

       sout(word1);-->Sunday
       sout(word2);-->Monday
