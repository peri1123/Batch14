    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1-What is polymorphism?
    --> it is a different forms of object(Poly--->Many morphism-->forms)

    2-What is dynamic and static polymorphism?
    *Dynamic PolymorMorphism: Run Time -->Overriding-->Dynamic(action)
    *Static PolyMorphism: Compile Time-->Overloading


    3-What is the difference between overloading and overriding?**(The most common)
    -->public void overloading (int a)
    -->public void overloading(int a, String b)
    -->Overloading needs to happen in the same class
    -->Overloading can have final,static, private keyword
    ***IT CHECKS THE METHOD SIGNATURE ONLY (NAME OF THE METHOD +PARAMETERS)
    **--> IT DOESN"T CARE ABOUT RETURN TYPE AND ACCESS MODIFIERS

    Overriding:
    -->Overriding needs to happen in parent-child relation class(Extends,Implement)
    --Override should have the same method signature(name and parameters)
    --Return type should be the same or co-variant
    --Overriding cannot have private,static,final keyword
