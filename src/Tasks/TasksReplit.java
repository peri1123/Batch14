        no ticket for the game. To be able to calculate the result you need to make sure max capacity of the
        stadium is more than sold tickets.
        The values for all 3 test will automatically be inserted on the lines 'int maxCapacity = (value) and int soldTickets=value'.
                NOTE: If statement is NOT needed for this question.
                Example 1:
        max capacity: 25
        number of sold tickets: 20
        true

        Example 2:
        max capacity: 18
        number of sold tickets: 20
        false

        Example 3:
        Please enter max capacity: 16
        Please enter number of sold tickets: 15
        true
